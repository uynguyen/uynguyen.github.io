# Education:
University of Science - Vietnam National University
Bachelor in Software Engineering, GPA 8.86 / 10.0
*Thesis: Web-based IDE for collaborating programming.*
This system allows users to create projects, build, run and debug applications online with an IDE that supports three majors programming languages: C/C++, C#, and Java. If there are any problems while development, users can post questions linked to their projects, other members will help them to solve the problems by answering the questions directly. By using this system, users will not have to spend time installing IDEs on their computers and reducing debugging time thanks to the help of the community.

### Software Development Kit – Fossil Group
The Fossil App is the companion app for Fossil’s line of smartwatches. Receive alerts from your favorite contacts and apps, compare multiple time zones and track everything from steps to sleep through the app. Turn your smartwatch into a remote control with customizable buttons that can control your music, check your commute time and more.
As a Device Integration Engineer, I develop an SDK built in Bluetooth Low Energy technology in iOS. The SDK lets the application communicate with smartwatches or trackers.
