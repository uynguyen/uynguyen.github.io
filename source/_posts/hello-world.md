Welcome to [Uy Nguyen's blog](https://uynguyen.github.io/)! 
I love writing, so I build this site to write any ~~stupid~~ ~~crap~~ things in my life, my job or whatever related to Software Engineering. In this way, I remember these topics longer. I also want to share what I learned to anyone who needs it.
Feel free to kick an email if you need to reach me.
