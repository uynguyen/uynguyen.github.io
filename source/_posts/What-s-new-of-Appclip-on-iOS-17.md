With the introduction of iOS 17, applications now have the ability to launch App Clips from other apps using the App Clip's invocation URL. This functionality opens up various possibilities. For instance, if you've developed a suite of apps, you can enable them to launch App Clips from one another, providing users with access to specific functionalities without the need for a full app installation.

Furthermore, your app could extend the offer to launch App Clips from other developers if your workflows involve interactions with those apps. This collaborative approach enhances user convenience, allowing them to seamlessly navigate between apps and leverage diverse functionalities. The interconnectivity fostered by this feature promotes a more integrated and user-centric experience within the iOS ecosystem.
